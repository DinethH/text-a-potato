				<h3>Is this a real potato?</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, of course! A 100% real British potato will be delivered to your nominated address with a hand written message on it.

				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>Why don't I buy a potato and post it myself?
				</h3>
				<p>Ahh, a rookie error. These aren’t your average, small, boring 50p potatoes from Aldi. These are large, expensive, organic,
					individually selected, heavy, seriously sexy potatoes. Also you don’t have the spud-tacular packaging, special long
					lasting ink and most likely can’t be bothered lining up at the post office for five hours.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>How is the potato posted?
				</h3>
				<p>All postage is via 1st or 2nd class Royal Mail. You choose which option you would prefer during checkout. Your potato
					will be carefully packaged and lovingly protected throughout its journey in our spud-rrific packaging.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>How long will it take to receive the potato?
				</h3>
				<p>Orders should be received within 1-5 business days, depending on the postage option you select. 1st class mail takes
					1-3 working days and 2nd class is 3-5 working days from dispatch. There is a 1-2 day processing time as each order is
					individually and lovingly created.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>How much does it cost?
				</h3>
				<p>The total cost is £6.99 for a potato with a personalised message and gift packaging. Postage is £2.99 for 2nd class or
					£4.99 for 1st class. Texts to 68899 are charged at a standard network rate.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>Where do you post potatoes to?
				</h3>
				<p> Currently we only post potatoes within the United Kingdom.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>What if my potato never arrives?
				</h3>
				<p>Please contact us immediately and we will let you know what has happened!

				<h3>Can I eat the potato?
				</h3>
				<p>
					We don't recommend it. Just admire the beauty that is the majestic potato!

				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>
					What should I say on the potato? Can you write anything?

				</h3>
				<p>
					You can have any message you want hand written on a potato (max 160 characters). However we reserve the right not to fulfill
					orders which are deemed bullying or upsetting in nature.

				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>What if I don't know my friend's address?
				</h3>

				<p>Try getting your potato delivered to their work or parent's address. Otherwise have it sent to yourself and hand the
					gift over in person and see their reaction!
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>What phone network do I need to be on?
				</h3>
				<p>All UK networks can order a potato.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>How do I use Text-A-Potato?
				</h3>
				<p>Simply follow the instructions on this web page, under 'Send A Potato'. If you get confused just send us an email at
					<a href="mailto:textapotato@gmail.com">textapotato@gmail.com</a>
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>How will I know the text has worked?
				</h3>
				<p>You will receive a free text from TEXT-A-POTATO with a payment link.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>Who can use Text-A-Potato?
				</h3>
				<p>Anyone in the UK!
				</p>


				<br>
				<h3>Will you keep texting and charging me?
				</h3>
				<p>This is not a subscripton service and you will only be charged each time you choose to use the service. There are no
					re-occuring charges.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>How do I pay?
				</h3>
				<p>You can check out with PayPal but you don't need a PayPal account. Or you can use VISA, Mastercard or American Express.
					Due to the delicate and personalised nature of the product, once orders are made we are unable to refund or cancel your
					order.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h3>What if my order is missing information?
				</h3>
				<p>If you order a potato and forget to include a personalised message, TEXT-A-POTATO will email you requesting more information.
					If we do not hear back from you within one week, our default message, "HI SPUD" will be written on your sexy potato.
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>Remember you must include both your personal address and the address of the person receiving the potato. If you only
					include your personal details, your handsome spud may be posted to your personal address.
				</p>
